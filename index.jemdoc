\nI am currently a software engineer at Oracle, where I work on building next-generation Oracle Database engine with a primary focus on efficient in-memory analytics and fast storage access.

Prior to joining Oracle, I received my PhD at UCSD in 2023 with [http://swanson.ucsd.edu/ Steven Swanson] on advanced software techniques for emerging memory technologies.

Before joining UCSD, I worked with [https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/ Mahesh Balakrishnan] on distributed systems at Yale University.

Before starting my graduate study, I worked as a software engineer at SAP Labs on building SAP HANA in-memory database engine.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University, Korea.
